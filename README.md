yeoman-foundation-generator
===========================

This is a basic Yeoman.io generator that's based on the 'quickstart' project but uses Zurb Foundation by default.

Copy the 'foundation' folder to your yeoman generators folder for now. (e.g. [YOUR YEOMAN INSTALL]/yeoman/cli/node_modules/yeoman-generators/lib/generators)
